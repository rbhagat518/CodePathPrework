## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications and favorite features:
1. TikTok:
- swiping left and right to view different content or account profile information
- swiping up and down to view different media
2. YouTube:
- mini player to watch/listen to video while doing other things
- double tapping left/right side of screen to rewind/fast-forward ten seconds
3. Twitter/ X the Everything App:
- the trending page
- replying to posts, ultimately creating a forum of large discussion  

I'd like to create an app focused on tracking an athlete's statistics thrpughput a season (perhaps with a detailed dashboard). The fantasy basketball and football industry would benefit from a way to keep track of underrated players. 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I largely followed the CodePath guide while developing the app. The hardest part was getting back into the js syntax like mindset within swift.
